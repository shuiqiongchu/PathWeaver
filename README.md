# PathWeaver
PathWeaver is a neural network model that predicts mouse movement paths. Given start and end coordinates, it generates intermediate points and the time delays between them. Ideal for simulating user interactions and enhancing motion prediction in applications, PathWeaver offers accurate trajectory analysis for interactive environments.
